# Gesture-Recognition-using-machine-learning
 The project was carried out as a part of Summer Internship At CDSAML, PES UNIVERSITY 2017.
## Working
<ul type=1>
 <li>SVM</li> 
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be employed for both classification and regression purposes.
 But in this case it is used for classification purpose. SVMs are based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into multiple clases. The SVM model was trained using hand digit image dataset which was manually generated and processed, the dataset consists of 5 classes totally and each class consists of approximately ~20 images which was processed and resized into 25x25.<br/>
 
</ul>
## Requirements
<ul type=1>
    <li>Python 3.6.5</li>
    <li>OpenCV 3</li>
    <li>Tensorflow 1.8.0 CPU support only</li> 
 <ul>
